This repo was a practice to learn how to save data in SQLite in API RESTFul


create the virtual environment and install flask dependencies from pip


dependencies: 

- Flask
- Flask-RESTFul
- flask-jwt


NOTE:
 run test.py it will create SQLite DB under the name of data.db and also it will create a couple of records there. 
 run app.py from code/app.py, run app.py will launch the server

Flask-JWT NOTE:
- As soon as we create the JWT object, Flask-JWT registers an endpoint with our application, /auth. 
- we can create an other path, example /login following a new configuration: app.config['JWT_AUTH_URL_RULE'] = '/login' 
- authenticate function is called with that username and password. Flask-JWT set this up when we created the JWT object.
-  Flask-JWT will take the id property of the user object and store that in the JWT
